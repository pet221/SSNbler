\title{Assemble an SSN object from a LSN}
\usage{
lsn_to_ssn(
  edges,
  lsn_path = NULL,
  obs_sites = NULL,
  preds_list = NULL,
  ssn_path,
  import = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{An \code{sf} object with LINESTING geometry created
using \code{\link{lines_to_lsn}} (see Details).}

\item{lsn_path}{Local pathname to a directory in character format
specifying where relationships.csv resides, which is created
using \code{link{lines_to_lsn}}.}

\item{obs_sites}{Optional. A single \code{sf} object with POINT geometry
created using \code{link{sites_to_lsn}} that represents the
observation locations (i.e. where data were collected). Default =
NULL (see Details).}

\item{preds_list}{Optional. A list of one or more \code{sf} objects
representing prediction sites.}

\item{ssn_path}{Pathname to an output directory where output files
will be stored. A .ssn extension will be added if it is not
included.}

\item{import}{Logical indicating whether the output files should be
returned as an \code{SSN} object. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{ssn_path}
already exists, the contents of \code{ssn_path} will be
overwritten. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Indicates whether messages about the
function progress should be printed to the console. Defaults to
\code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{SSN}.  The function returns an object of class \code{SSN}. The output is also stored locally in \code{ssn_path} (see Details).

\description{
Create an SSN object from a Landscape Network (LSN).

\details{
The \code{SSNbler} package is used to generate the
spatial, topological, and attribute information needed to fit
spatial stream-network models using the \code{SSN2} package. The
\code{lsn_to_ssn} function will often be the final step in the
\code{SSNbler} data-processing workflow and it is important that
the previous processing steps have been followed. Prior to
running \code{lsn_to_ssn}, the \code{edges} must be processed
using \code{link{lines_to_lsn}}, \code{link{updist_edges}}, and
\code{link{afv_edges}}. The \code{obs_sites} and prediction site
datasets in \code{preds_list} must be processed with
\code{link{sites_to_lsn}}, \code{link{updist_sites}}, and
\code{link{afv_sites}}. In addition, the \code{edges},
\code{obs_sites}, and all of the \code{sf} objects in
\code{preds_list} must be part of the same LSN.

The \code{obs_sites} and \code{preds_list} are optional arguments,
with the Default = NULL. If \code{obs_sites = NULL}, an
\code{SSN} object will be returned with NA stored in
\code{ssn.object$obs} and a warning returned that
\code{ssn.object$obs} is required for fitting spatial statistical
models in \code{SSN2}.

\code{lsn_to_ssn} stores the output locally in \code{ssn_path}. If
\code{ssn_path} does not include the .ssn extension, it is added
before the new directory is created. This directory contains:
\itemize{
\item edges.gpkg: edges in geopackage format. A new network identifier, netID, is added that is unique to each subnetwork.
\item sites.gpkg: observed sites in geopackage format (if present). Three new ID columns are added that are unqiue to the measurement (pid), the location (locID), and the network (netID).
\item prediction datasets in geopackage format (if present). The prediction sites also contain pid, locID, and netID. The naming convention is taken from the names provided in \code{preds_list}.
\item netID.dat files for each distinct network, which store the binaryID values for line segments in edges.
}
A more detailed description of the .ssn directory and its contents is provided in Peterson and Ver Hoef (2014).
