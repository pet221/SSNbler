# SSNbler: Assemble 'SSN' objects

'SSNbler' imports, creates and assembles data needed to fit spatial-statistical stream-network models using the [SSN2 R package](https://usepa.github.io/SSN2/). Streams, observations, and prediction locations are represented as simple features and specific tools have been provided to define topological relationships between features; calculate the hydrologic distances (with flow-direction preserved) and the spatial additive function used to weight converging stream segments; and export the topological, spatial, and attribute information to an SSN object, which can be efficiently stored, accessed and analysed in R.  

Learn more about 'SSNbler' on [our website](https://pet221.github.io/SSNbler/).
